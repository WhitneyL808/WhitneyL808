## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ALOHA and welcome to Whitney Lugos GitHub. You are here because you have intrest in my work and myself, I understand. Well, I am a student at Eastern Washington University finishing up my Visual Communication Design degree while also completing a UX/Web design certificate. I am passionate about technology and how it impacts us from day 2 day and year 2 year. My current intrest is UX and Web design since it is a growing industry and I feel like I can learn more about it everyday! Enough about the basics scroll around, relax, and enjoy what my GitHub has to offer. If you have any questions feel free to reach out on one of the links below!
